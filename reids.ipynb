I have a small amount of web dev experience and am looking forward to learning more in a web development class I am taking next semester for my Master'd degree in Computer Science.

Then the dropdown is added with all of the unique countries in the df. The default selection is Canada. An id is assigned; this might be if more elements are created, then the elements can be modified by their id. Then the graph element is added to the higher level div, but nothing is done with it yet.
